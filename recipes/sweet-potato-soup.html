    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 large carrots, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>4cm/1½ inches fresh root ginger, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>½ tsp dried red chilli flakes</li>
            <li>700g/1lb 10oz sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>1.2 litres/2 pints vegetable stock</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large, lidded saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the onion and carrots and cook until softened. Stir in the ginger, garlic and chilli flakes and fry for 2–3 minutes, or until fragrant.</li>
